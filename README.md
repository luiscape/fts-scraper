FTS Scraper 
===========

This scraper is built to extract data from OCHA's Financial Tracking Service (http://fts.unocha.org) using its API (http://fts.unocha.org/api/Files/APIUserdocumentation.htm). 

The idea is to start extracting the data into CSVs using first the emergency as a criteria, then the other XML tags. 

[This is an experiment.]
